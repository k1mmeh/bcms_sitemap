# Sitemap module

Version 1.0

I welcome all feedback and suggestions regarding functionality, working or not.  Or
suggestions of how it could work better.

This module adds a basic sitemap for the site, as supported by google.  It finds all 
pages that are considered 'public' in the CMS, so itself does not need authentication.  
Currently this does not support the BCMS caching model.  I would like to include it 
in the caching system shortly.
The module has been designed to one day support more sitemap formats.  If there are
any suggestions for other formats, please send me details and I'll attempt to include.
I think this should be configurable via the static config file for this module.

To install, download the source from github at http://github.com/k1mmeh/bcms_sitemap.
Then inside the root directory of the downloaded source, run:
  gem build bcms_sitemap.gemspec

Then install the gem by running:
  gem install bcms_sitemap-1.0.gem

Now edit config/environment.rb and add the following line AFTER the inclusion of the
browsercms gem:
  config.gem 'bcms_sitemap', :version => '1.0'

Then to install the files appropriately, run:
  ruby script/generate browser_cms

This will have copied a file to RAILS_ROOT/config/sitemap.yml.sample.  Copy this file
to RAILS_ROOT/config/sitemap.yml and edit the only config variable 'root_path' to 
reflect the address of your site.

Now the sitemap should be accessible at <your_site>/sitemap.xml.  If you want the sitemap
to appear at a different location, edit the routes file by adding the following lines to
your routes file ABOVE the map.routes_for_browser_cms instruction:
  
  map.with_options(:controller => 'cms/sitemap') do |sm|
    sm.foo_bar '<your_custom_path>', :action => 'google'
  end

Let me know if you think the url should be configurable.
